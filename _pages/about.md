## Why this blog exists?

It exists so I can have a place where I post stuff that I'm currently learning. 
I personally believe in the "Fayman's" approach to studying - that the best way to learn something is to to teach others. 
Due to that, I decided to regularly post articles about the things I'm currently studying.  

## Who am I?

My name is Piotr Mazurek, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, currently working in a drone start-up on the computer vision problems.

I'm interested in a wide variety of data science-related topics, ranging from the techniques of winning 
the data science competitions to the ethical issues of AI.
